## Viewing Progress & Metrics

### Understanding Progress Calculations

**How Progress is Calculated**:
1. Each metric shows: (Current ÷ Target) × 100
2. Goal progress = Average of all its metrics
3. Objective progress = Average of all its goals

**Example**:
- Math Proficiency: 75/100 students = **75% progress**
- Reading Level: 80/100 students = **80% progress**
- **Goal Average**: (75% + 80%) ÷ 2 = **77.5% progress**

### Metric Types You'll See

1. **Percentages** (%):
   - Test scores, proficiency rates
   - Example: "85% of students proficient"

2. **Numbers** (#):
   - Enrollment, attendance, incidents
   - Example: "450 students enrolled"

3. **Ratings** (⭐):
   - Survey results, satisfaction scores
   - Example: "4.2 out of 5 stars"

4. **Currency** ($):
   - Budget allocations, spending
   - Example: "$50,000 invested"

5. **Status Indicators**:
   - Qualitative milestones
   - Example: "Phase 2 Complete"

### Success Stories

- 📖 Real examples of progress
