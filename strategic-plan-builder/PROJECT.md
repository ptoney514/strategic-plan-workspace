## 📝 Session History
> Quick reference of recent work

### Last 5 Sessions
- **2025-01-01**: Created Claude Code configuration files
- **2024-12-31**: Fixed dashboard and strategic goals functionality
- **2024-12-30**: Added comprehensive dashboard view selector
- **2024-12-29**: Implemented hierarchical goals UI and dark mode
- **2024-12-28**: Created pixel-perfect homepage from Figma

## 🔗 Quick Links
- **Repository**: [Local Development]
- **Staging**: http://localhost:3000
- **Production**: Not deployed
- **Database**: [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/qsftokjevxueboldvmzc)
- **API Docs**: See `/api` routes in codebase
- **Design Files**: `/design` folder (removed from repo)

## 📚 Architecture Decisions
> Key decisions and their rationale

1. **Next.js App Router**: Modern React patterns, better performance
2. **Supabase over custom backend**: Faster development, built-in auth
3. **3-level hierarchy**: Matches strategic planning best practices
4. **Tailwind + Radix UI**: Consistent design system with accessibility
5. **Client-side hierarchy building**: Flexibility for complex views

## 🚦 Definition of Done
- [ ] Feature works in both light and dark mode
- [ ] Responsive on mobile, tablet, desktop
- [ ] Data persists correctly to Supabase
- [ ] No console errors or warnings
- [ ] Lint and build pass successfully
- [ ] User-facing features have loading states
- [ ] Error states handled gracefully
