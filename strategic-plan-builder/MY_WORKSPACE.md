## ðŸ“š KEY INFO

### Project Details
- **Name**: Strategic Plan Builder
- **Type**: Full-Stack Web Application (SaaS for Educational Administration)
- **Stack**: Next.js 14.2.5, TypeScript, Supabase, Tailwind CSS, Recharts
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Supabase)
- **Schema**: `strategic_plan_builder` (custom schema)
- **UI Components**: Radix UI + Tailwind CSS

### Supabase Configuration
- **Project ID**: qsftokjevxueboldvmzc
- **URL**: Configured in `.env.local`
- **Tables**:
  - `spb_districts` - Organizations/districts
  - `spb_goals` - Hierarchical goals (3 levels)
  - `spb_metrics` - Performance metrics

### Key Architecture Decisions
1. **3-Level Hierarchy**: Strategic Objectives â†’ Goals â†’ Sub-goals
2. **Automatic Numbering**: Goals numbered as 1, 1.1, 1.1.1 (via `getNextGoalNumber`)
3. **Flexible Metrics**: Support for %, #, $, ratings, status
4. **Public/Private**: Districts can be public or require auth
5. **Schema Isolation**: Using dedicated schema instead of public
6. **Data Flow**: Frontend uses `dbService` wrapper, API uses direct Supabase
7. **Hierarchy Building**: Both client-side and server-side via `buildGoalHierarchy`

### Sample Districts (Development)
- Omaha Public Schools (`/dashboard/omaha`)
- Denver Public Schools (`/dashboard/denver`)
- Austin Independent School District (`/dashboard/austin`)

### API Routes
- `/api/districts/[slug]` - Get district with full goal hierarchy
- `/api/districts/[slug]/goals` - CRUD operations for goals
- `/api/districts/[slug]/metrics` - CRUD operations for metrics
- `/api/districts/[slug]/goals/next-number` - Generate sequential goal numbers

### Core Components
- `StrategicGoalsOverview` - Executive dashboard with goal summaries
- `GoalDrilldown` - Detailed goal management interface
- `PublicStrategicDashboard` - Public-facing dashboard
- `MetricCard` / `MetricInput` - Metric display and editing
- `OverviewV2` - Enhanced strategic goals overview

### Important Files
- `lib/db-service.ts` - Database operations wrapper
- `lib/types.ts` - TypeScript interfaces & hierarchy utilities
- `lib/supabase.ts` - Supabase client config
- `migrations/001_refactor_to_hierarchical.sql` - Schema migration script
